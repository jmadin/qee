<p class="message">
  People working in the Quantitative Ecology & Evolution group have a number of resources available to them for research.
</p>

* INSTRON material testing machine
* A growing corpus of programming code for data manipulation and modelling, mostly in R, but also in Perl, Python and Ruby.
* Two servers for processor-intensive mathematical and GIS modelling and hosting websites.
* Several large databases, including the Coral Traits Database.
All the necessary equipment for intertidal and sub-tidal (diving) ecological fieldwork, and numerous tools and resources for building equipment that we donâ€™t yet have.
* An INSTRON mechanical testing unit.
* A high-speed circulating flume tank.
